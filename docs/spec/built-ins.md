# Built-Ins
This chapter describes the objects built in to the standard “core” Solid library.



## Primitive Types
The primitive object types `Null`, `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Float`, and `String`
and are discussed in the [Data Types](./data-types.md) chapter.
They are mentioned here for completeness.



## Tuple
`Tuple` objects are fixed-size ordered lists of indexed values, with indices starting at `0`.
The values of tuples are Solid Language Values.



## Record
`Record` objects are fixed-size unordered lists of keyed values, with identifier keys.
The values of records are Solid Language Values.



## List
`List` objects are variable-size ordered lists of indexed values, with indices starting at `0`.
The values of lists are Solid Language Values.



## Hash
`Hash` objects are variable-size unordered lists of keyed values, with identifier keys.
The values of hashes are Solid Language Values.



## Set
`Set` objects are variable-size unordered lists of values.
The values of sets are Solid Language Values.



## Map
`Map` objects are variable-size unordered associations of values.
The antecedents and consequents of maps are Solid Language Values.
